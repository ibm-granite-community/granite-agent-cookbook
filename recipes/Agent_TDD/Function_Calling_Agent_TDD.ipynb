    "In this recipe, you will use the IBM® [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite) model now available on watsonx.ai™ to perform custom function calling.  \n",

    "Traditional [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models), like the OpenAI GPT-5 (generative pre-trained transformer) model available through ChatGPT, and the IBM Granite™ models that we'll use in this recipe, are limited in their knowledge and reasoning. They produce their responses based on the data used to train them and are difficult to adapt to personalized user queries. To obtain the missing information, these [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) models can integrate external tools within the function calling. This method is one way to avoid fine-tuning a foundation model for each specific use-case. The function calling examples in this recipe will implement external [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api) calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Granite model and tokenizer use [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) to parse query syntax. In addition, the models use function descriptions and function parameters to determine the appropriate tool calls. Key information is then extracted from user queries to be passed as function arguments. "
